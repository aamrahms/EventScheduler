# Event Tracker

## Overview

Group project for INFO 6150 Web Design and User Experince Engineering.
We have created an Event Tracker for Boston, MA USA Specific events happening around Northeastern Campus and the city.

## Inspiration

Our Inspiration stemmed from having a centralized place to track events happening in Boston. Given how culturally diverse the city is with all the number of events happening around in various genre like music, theater, social, tech, etc. it's often difficult to have a tab on everthing happening around.

We provide a solution for people who want to explore the city and it's events to browse through the events on one centralized place.
